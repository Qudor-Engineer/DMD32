# DMD32
A library for driving the Freetronics 512 pixel dot matrix LED display "DMD", a 32 x 16 layout using ESP32.

This library is a fork of the original one [(DMD)](https://github.com/freetronics/DMD) modified to support ESP32 (currently it is only working on ESP32).

The connection between ESP32 and DMD display shown in the image below:

I changed the SPI to VSPI and used ESP32 hardware timer and more miner modifications.

#Unfortunately, this library is no longer maintained. If you face any problem you can fork it to do your modification.
